The solution involves systematically checking your native dependencies and Expo configuration. Here's a breakdown of debugging strategies:

1. **Clean your project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`. This can resolve issues caused by corrupted or inconsistent dependency versions.
2. **Verify `app.json`/`app.config.js`:**  Double-check your app's configuration files to ensure that all native dependencies listed are valid and compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Any typos or incorrect module names can cause failures.
3. **Check the Expo SDK version:** Ensure that your SDK version is supported and compatible with all your native dependencies.  Outdated SDKs can conflict with newer libraries.
4. **Examine the complete error log:**  The initial error message might be just the tip of the iceberg. Scrutinize the entire error log, as it often contains more details on where the issue originated.
5. **Simplify your app:** If possible, try creating a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the problematic dependency. This will make it easier to pinpoint the exact cause.
6. **Check Expo documentation and community forums:** Search for similar issues in the Expo documentation and community forums (e.g., Stack Overflow, the Expo forums).  Others might have encountered and resolved the same or similar problems.
7. **Use `expo diagnostics`:** Run `expo diagnostics` to check the overall health of your development environment.  This can uncover underlying issues that might be contributing to the build failures.
