This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command or during the build process itself.  The root cause is often a mismatch between the native dependencies (iOS and Android) specified in your app's configuration (usually `app.json` or `app.config.js`) and the actual native code that Expo manages.  It might also indicate a problem during the download or installation of these native modules. The error message itself might not pinpoint the exact problem, making debugging challenging.
