# Expo CLI: Unclear Native Dependency Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue during Expo's build process where unclear error messages hinder debugging. The problem arises when native dependencies fail to resolve properly, leading to a failed build. The error messages provided by Expo are often insufficient for pinpointing the root cause.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Attempt to run `expo prebuild` or `expo build:ios` (or `expo build:android`).
4. Observe the unclear error message.  The exact error might vary based on the specific dependency issue.

## Solution

The solution involves a more thorough check of your app's native dependencies. The provided `bugSolution.js` contains strategies to help diagnose the issues.
